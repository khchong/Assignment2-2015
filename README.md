Note:
	-Please use the **Google Chrome** browser when trying out this webapp. We have not tested the UI and overall functionality with other browsers. 

Design Principles:

-One thing we added was a loading screen when looking at our d3 visualization for facebook liked pages. We did this because we pull about 40 pages from facebook and the information tied to them, which takes a while sometimes. The loading screen ensures the user knows that the webapp is loading the view, rather than seeing a blank page with nothing on their for more than 10 seconds. This idea follows Nielsen's Heuristic design principle of "Visibility of System Status".

-Another thing we added was the ability to unlink and link different social media accounts. Some users do not wish to forever grant access to their other accounts. Granting the ability to unlink their accounts after having seen the webapp allows users to have the freedom and control they desire, rather than being constrained. In other words, this follows the "User Control and Freedom" principle from Nielsen's Heuristics.
